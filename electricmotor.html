        The electric motor has been an essential tool for daily life since it's creation in the 19th century. From powering our household appliances, to propelling electric vehicles down the road, electric motors fit just about any need to do physical task maually. Let's take a look at a few key points about the electric motor, such as:

        While many variations of the electric motor have been created over the years by engineers, the main two inventors of the electric motor were William Sturgeon and Nikola Tesla. Sturgeon made the first useable electric motor, a commutator DC electric motor, in 1832. He also invented the commutator, an integral part of the electric motor to this very day. Nikola Tesla invented the first AC motor, the induction motor, in 1887 at the age of 21. Tesla would later on make design the electric motors that would power Niagra falls.

        DC Motors

      <p>
        DC (otherwise known as Direct Current) motors operate on the principle of attraction and repulsion of magnetism to convert kenetic energy into mechanical energy. When a DC motor is powered, a magnetic field is created in its stator. The field attracts and repels magnets on the rotor; this causes the rotor to rotate. To keep the rotor continually rotating, the commutator that is attached to brushes connected to the power source supply current to the motors wire windings.

        There are four main types of DC motors:

          <li>
            Permanent Magnet DC motor
          </li>
          <li>
            Series motor

        AC Motors
      </header>
      <p>
        AC (otherwise known as Alternating Current) motors are electric motor that consists of a stator with a coil that is supplied with alternating current to convert electric current into mechanical power. In AC motors, you have a ring of electromagnets as the stator, which generate a rotating magnetic field when current is applied to them. Unlike in a DC motor, where you send power to the inner rotor, in an AC motor you send power to the outer coils that make up the stator. The coils are energized in pairs, in sequence, producing a magnetic field that rotates around the outside of the motor. This rotating magnetic field propells the motor via the rotor.The magnetic field is constantly changing (because it's rotating) so, according to the laws of electromagnetism (Faraday's law, to be precise), the magnetic field produces (or induces, to use Faraday's own term) an electric current inside the rotor. If the conductor is a ring or a wire, the current flows around it in a loop. If the conductor is simply a solid piece of metal, eddy currents swirl around it instead. Either way, the induced current produces its own magnetic field and, according to another law of electromagnetism (Lenz's law) tries to stop whatever it is that causes it—the rotating magnetic field—by rotating as well. (You can think of the rotor frantically trying to "catch up" with the rotating magnetic field in an effort to eliminate the difference in motion between them.) Electromagnetic induction is the key to why a motor like this spins, and is also where the name for one of the types of AC motors comes from.

        As mentioned before, electric motors are widely used in day to day life due to their inherit effciency, ability to provide full power near zero RPM, and proven reliablity. Here are some of the things electric motors power in our lives:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Windshield wiper
          </li>
          <li>
            Starter motor in Internal Combustion Engines
          </li>
          <li>
            Traction motor in electric vehicles
          </li>
          <li>
            Personal computer disc drives
          </li>
          <li>
            Blowers in heater and air conditioners
          </li>
          <li>
            Ceiling fans
          </li>
          <li>
            Computer fans
          </li>  
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see, today's modern world would be lost without the assistance of the electric motor!
